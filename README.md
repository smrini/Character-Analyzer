The way to use this scripts going to depend on wich files your are using.
If you ddecided to download and use the python source code, you'll have to make sure to download the necessary libraries for each script.
But if you are on indows I provided a .exe compiled version. that you can use directly.
just run the script, and when it asks you for the link, just put the direct path to a local file or a link from the internet.
